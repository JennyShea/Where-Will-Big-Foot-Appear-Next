"NOTE: Substance Use Disorder (SUD) data in 2020 are based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). SUD is defined as meeting the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder. SUD estimates are based on only 2020 data because prior years’ SUD data were based on DSM-IV criteria.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one’s own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
